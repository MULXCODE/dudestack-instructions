# A modern Front End development environment

My company is a digital agency called Dude (Digitoimisto Dude Oy), [check out the company website](https://www.dude.fi) where I'm the head of technical development at the moment. I'm using plenty of tools, apps, modules, frameworks which together are called "stack". Dudestack-instructions contains information about these tools *and* instructions on how to set up a similar stack.

This repo and instructions exist only because my envinroment setup is growing so fast and there's simply too many repositories to consider when building the stack from scratch.

The instructions assume that you don't have *anything* pre-installed. If you have something installed, please just skip the step. Scroll down to [Installation](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/dudestack-instructions#installation).

This is just a tip of the iceberg, but I hope it's useful to you.

**Note:** [The Instructions](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/dudestack-instructions#installation) are completely untested, so feel free to do so and throw an issue if something doesn't work out just quite it should.
