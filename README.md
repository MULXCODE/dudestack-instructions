# A modern Front End development environment

This is a development manual for a digital agency called Dude (Digitoimisto Dude Oy), [check out the company website](https://www.dude.fi) where [@ronilaukkarinen](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen) is the head of technical development at the moment. Dude is using plenty of tools, apps, modules, frameworks which together are called "stack". Dudestack-instructions contains information about these tools *and* instructions on how to set up a similar stack.

This wiki and instructions exist only because Dude's envinroment setup is growing in a fast pace and there's simply too many repositories to consider when building the stack from scratch.

The instructions assume that you don't have *anything* pre-installed. If you have something installed, please just skip the step. Scroll down to [Installation](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/dudestack-instructions#installation).

We hope you enjoy!
